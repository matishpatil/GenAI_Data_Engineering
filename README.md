# GenAI_Data_Engineering
Generative AI can be used in solving Data Engineering problems, build solutions and combine different data components to create data pipelines.

## Topics Covered
* File Processing - CSV, JSON
* Data Quality
* Data Pipelines
* ETL vs ELT
* Data Modeling

## Tools Used
* Python
* SQL
* CMD
* Bash Scripting

## Data Engineering
* Design and build data pipelines
* Extract, load, transform, integrate and store data
* Design scalable data infrastructure
* Measure and provide tools to improve data quality
* Requires coding skills and systems thinking
* Generative AI is changing the level of coding skill needed

## Large Language Models (LLMs)
* ChatGPT - OpenAI - v3.5, v4.0
* BARD - Google
* Claude - ANTHROP\C
* Llama - Facebook
* Phi - Microsoft Research - Small datasets

## Data Quality
* Completeness - all expected data points present
* Consistency - data formats and values follow defined rules
* Accuracy - data values correct and within expected range
* Uniqueness - there are no duplicates or identifiers
* Validity - data values conform to defined constraints - business rules
* Timeliness - data is relevant and up-to-date

## Data Integrity Checks
* Compare data loaded against trusted sources or external datasets
* Identify and investigate unusual data points or outliers
* Look for inconsistencies such as absence of expected correlations
* Use regular expressions to check formats and patterns
* Check for duplicate records, missing values
* Check for inconsistent date and time formats
